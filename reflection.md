- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why? 
In the cafe class I decided to overload the constructor to have a new constructor that creates a default cafe that takes in a name and adress but already has all the attributes and number of floors set, to make it easier to create a cafe. I also overloaded the sellCoffee method to make a default one so that a set amount of each item in the inventory will be sold a day.

In the house class I overloaded the constructor to create a default house that also takes in a name and address but already has the number of floors set and no elevator or dining room to make it easier to create houses. I also overloaded the moveIn method to be able to move in an arraylist of students so that you don't have to individually move students into a house to make it much more effiecient. 

In the library class I overloaded the constructor to create a default library that takes in a name and address but has a set amount of floors and has an elevator to make it faster/standardize the libraries. I also overloaded the addTitle method that takes in an arraylist of strings so that many books can be added at once to the collection to make it faster to add books. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was creating the overloaded methods, it was honestly quite fun when I realized I could be as creative as I wanted with the overloaded methods. Therefore, since I already had the original method to use as a guide it was much easier to make the overloaded ones. However, what I struggled with was making the overided methods. At first it was confusing adding the method from the building class and then ensuring that what I am trying to change into the new class is working cohesively with what is already in the method. However, after trial and error I was able to figure it out. Advise I would give is to give yourself time, know that you are capable, eventually you will figure out the errors and be able to debug faster, and ask for help whenever you need it!!!
